Add collisions
  -When 2 particles come close enough to each other, they become one particle.
  -New particle's mass will be equivalent to the sum of the original particle's masses
  -New particle's momentum will be equivalent to the sum of the original particle's momentums
Add visual representation of size
  -Radius of particle is proportional to its mass
Add initial disk rotation
  -When the disk of particles is generated, particles are more likely to have an initial velocity that would result in an overall spinning disk
Get simulation settings from user, rather than having them pre-defined in the source code
  -Use the console to ask for settings
