# 2D-Accretion-Simulation
This is an old, now abandoned project I did in my senior year of high school to explore multi-threading and physics simulations.  
If you'd like to watch a few of the renderings of the simulation, check out this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8DyCuld6vsKOp_jDzYFnVmI58OQiFuPw)!
